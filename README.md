# Visualizing the FY2017 DoD Budget Request
To get a better sense of what is being requested and the numbers involved, I started a rather quick and dirty exploratory analysis of DOD budget data using D3 and the original Budget Request data.

To view the original Excel-based data, the 2017 ammended budget request from the department of defense is available directly from the DoD Comptroller

Visualizing data like this is much easier with source JSON. Working these numbers with D3, especially so I thought I might share the conversions for other intrepid data travelers. I may process these further in the future to facilitate correct types, etc but for now I have left them in their original "casted" string format.
